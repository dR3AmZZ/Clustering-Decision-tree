1-Hyperparameter tuning on Dash
Using web app Dash to conduct a hyperparameter tuning for association rules. Visualize the results via Dash

2-Weather forcast:
Use Cluster Analysis and Decision Tree induction algorithm on a weather forecast problem. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a location will get rain the next day.

3-Disease prediction
Using algorithm like Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM as classifiers to solve binary classfication problem to predict wheter a people has disease.
